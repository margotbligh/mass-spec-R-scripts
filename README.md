# Scripts for analysis of DI-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS data recorded for studies of marine sugars.

## Details of specific scripts:

### DI-MS_average_spectra.R 

Average spectra by file within a specific time range. Assumes only MS1 data. For the sample set the script was written for, an air bubble was in the capillary while one sample was infused. This is confirmed by plotting the TIC for that sample.
